# VNF-Deployment

A simulation program for a heuristic algorithm aimed to improve VNF deployment in data center networks.

Reference:

- [VNF (Virtualized Network Function)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Functions_Virtualization)

## Purpose

The algorithm aims to improve the VNF deployment in data center in a way that

- Less traffic is generated
- Less VNF is deployed
